# SystemAnalysisAndDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

Our client DriverPass wants to create a cloud-based system that will allow clients to schedule test, modify appointments, and practice driving tests. 
After speaking with the owner Liam, we have learned that the system needs to be able to disable packages that DriverPass does not want customers to have access to at any given time.
Different user roles which include: users, admin, and maintenance. 
DriverPass will require access to online information and the ability to download information for offline use within excel. 
The owner also has requested to be connected to the DMV and receive instant notifications whenever the DMV makes changes or updates to their rules and regulations. 
DriverPass requires full access for their IT Officer, Ian. Ian should have access to all user accounts and the ability to edit, reset passwords, or block users from the system. 
DriverPass requires functionality for users to reset passwords with ease. 
I think i laid the business requiments out well. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could pick one thing to revise from these documents it would be my diagrams. I think that I could have been more indepth with a few of my UML diagragms. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I would listen to what they're trying to achieve and translate that into actions that the system can perform. It's essential to consider the user's needs when developing to ensure you create the correct product. If not, you could lose time, money, and the clients trust if the project is wrong.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In the future I will use UML charts that were taught to me in this course. They make the whole life cycle of the development much easier and achievable.
